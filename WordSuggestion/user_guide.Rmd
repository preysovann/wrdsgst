# Summary
This application aims to predict the most likely next word based on a string of text that you enter in the input box.
                            
# Databases
To make prediction the application uses a mixed sample of news, blogs and twitter text, which has been manipulated in order to facilitate the prediction process.

# App Usage
You can type any text in the input box. The only limitation is that it needs to consist of only non-numeric, non-special characters and spaces. If the text length is 2 words or more, the algorithm will isolate the last two words and make a prediction based on these. If you only input one word, the algorithm will make a prediction based on that. Since the maximum input has been restricted to two words to make the application faster, some of the predictions might not make sense when inputting large sentences.

# App Algorithms
The algorithm calculates the probabilities of the next word occurring and presents three words that have the highest probability to be the next word based on the input provided. If there is no prediction based on the input, the output will display NA
